# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
The website consists of 4 webpages. First page is "content Table", designed using bootstrap grid layout. Second page is basically an HTML tutorial where I have tried to demonstrate some of the basics of HTML. Third page is the application of HTML and "Internal CSS" . In this page I have used #id selector to relatively position the components of page to achieve the look of the page. Page 4 is completely based upon css and HTML. The nesting part of "mystyle.css" comes from another .css file named "mystyle2.css". "Mystyle2.css" is the result of compilation of "style.scss" file. The "style.scss" file is compiled using SASS. the "mystyle.css" is an external style sheet.
