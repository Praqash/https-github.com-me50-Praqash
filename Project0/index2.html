     <h1>This is the fourth and final page!</h1

      <ul>
      <li>Here I have demonstrated some basics of CSS and scss. Like if the width of screen goes smaller than 600px background will turn green.   </li>
      <li> This page is externally styled by External Stylesheet</li>
      </ul>

  <h2>Now lets see 5 different properties of CSS</h2>

      <ol>
        <li class="a">Background color property. Using which i have set the background color to light blue. The command used is "background: lightblue".</li>
        <li class="b"> The font style property. Notice how size, colour and font is different for this psragraph compared to others. This is because of font property set for class named "a"</li>
        <li class="c"> Inherit property. For example the font style of this line is inherited from its parent class, which is class "html".</li>
        <li> Here i have used "Inline Block Display property" of CSS to display <p class="d">HELLO WORLD!</p> in line and as a block in red colour.</li>
        <li class="e"> Here i have demonstrated margin and padding property of css, as you can see, this line has a margin and padding in it. Also it is centered aligned using elemen selector.</li>
        <div id="box2">
          <img src ="/Users/Praqash/github/sun.png" alt="sun" width="600" height="450">
        </div>
<li> The picture above is placed using #id selector.
